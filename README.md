VirtualSpecies
==============

script for create virtual species, sample occurrence points, model ecological niches and analyze how fossil data improve ENM predictions.

Virtual ecologist approach have been increasingly used in last years to drive the challenges from real datasets. Here, we aim improve ENM predictions by adding fossil records to better inform the conditions under which species can survive. For this we are creating virtual species to allow a right and controled evaluation of how fossil data affect predictions.
